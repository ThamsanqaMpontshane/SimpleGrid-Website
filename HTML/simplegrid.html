            <p class="col-6 p1">Cape Town is one of the most beautiful city in South Africa . It comprises of Table Mountain and Robben Island which are the most visited tourist attractions in Cape Town . Although Cape Town is my Home town the are some places I haven't   visited before like Robben Island and  Cape Town Diamond Meuseum which I hope to visit by this year . Not only is Cape Town a tourist hub it is also a business hub that provides employment to thousands of MOTHER CITY residents.</p>
