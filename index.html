          America .It is the most populated city in the country. It comprises of
          Central Park and Statue of Liberty which are the most visited tourist
          attractions in New York . The Place I would like to visit the most is

            The Castle of Good Hope known locally as the Castle or Cape Town

            following land reclamation the fort is now located inland. In 1936
            the Castle was declared a historical monument (now a provincial
            heritage site) and following restorations in the 1980s it is
            considered the best preserved example of a Dutch East India Company
            fort
